# TERMINOLOGIES

GitHub actions: Refer to the CI/CD pipeline for free offered by GitHub. A playbook file is placed in you're projects codebase
and code is used to configure CI/CD such as compiling the code on a Windows VM then pushing that code to Cloud for production.

Runners: are the VM/Docker platforms that the environment is defined in the yml playbook is run on.
E.g, if you want to test and deploy python code the .yml file will outline steps to install packages on an Ubuntu VM/Docker for subsequent CI/CD
testing before deployment

# REQUIREMENTS

See INSTALATION

# INSTALLATION

To use GitHub CI/CD first install Git on your computer. It's an executable which when installed adds all the necessary GUI or Command
lines to push your code changes to the GitHub cloud servers.

Follow this document to install and setup Git on your device - git.md

Github actions is an CI/CD pipeline to push code to GitHub and trigger any additional commands e.g, to compile, test, push on success, etc.,

To use Github actions in your GitHub project all you need to do is create this file and filepath in the top level of your project
./.github/workflows/actions.yml

Then you just define rules as discussed later on within this guide and you have full CI/CD pipeline. GitHub playbooks comes with predefined
code for doing basic instructions such as using a specific VM or setting up a timelimit before a VM stops running and the workflow cancels
to prevent overrunning and consuming resources which could be expensive. GitHub only supports free code up to a certain usage in storage, performance
and time.

To extend the functionality of the playbook such as to adopt new technologies like pushing to a new Cloud provider, third party developers
can create GitHub actions Marketplace workflows which are similar to mini GitHub repositories only for use in playbooks.

## MARKETPLACE

The example playboko below has inbuilt code for naming the workflow job and using a specific runner, but the "uses" keyword
define marketplace workflows such as below "jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@v0.5.1" is a created by a third party developer to extend the
basic CI/CD functionality to allow pushing to S3. This way the playbook can be extended indefinitely and customised however you desire.

```yml
name: actions
run-name: Deploy to S3 bucket

on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Sync to S3
        uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@v0.5.1
        with:
          args: --delete
        env:
          AWS_S3_BUCKET: sumeetchand.com.com
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_REGION: us-east-1
          SOURCE_DIR: './build'
```

          if [ -f "linux-ffmpeg-build.tar.gz" ]; then
            tar -xzvf linux-ffmpeg-build.tar.gz -C /home/runner
          else
            echo "Artifact not found, skipping extraction"
            exit 1

          ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/ffmpeg/install --enable-shared --enable-gpl --disable-programs
          make -j$(nproc)
          sudo make install
```

# SECRETS AND KEYS 

Repo's can have Repository/environmental secrets and keys which allow you to add keys such as API's in GitHub repo page
and not within the code base itself. So when the code is pushed to GitHub, a GitHub actions CI/CD workflow will find that secret key
and add it to the code so that it's not exposed.

To add keys you must go to the Repo page - settings - secrets - then choose either for repository or environment
then add the keys name in name field, and the ID value in ID field and save.

Then within a GitHub actions yaml file include the hidden variables e.g, ```${secrets.KEYNAME}```

EXAMPLE 
Website www.agnisamooh.com has a S3 bucket to upload the react website live to.
1. Within AWS a secret Key pair are created as below
[vscode-aws-toolkit]
aws_access_key_id = alksjdalksjdalksjd
aws_secret_access_key = asjdlkasjdlksajdlkajsdsdjsalk
2. Then in the GitHub secrets and variables page they are added: the GitHub repo https://.github.com/SumeetChandJi/agnisamooh.com/settings/secrets/actions
3. Then in the project folder a new path is created under ./.github/workflows/actions.yml
4. The below code is added to it. Now when the code is pushed to GitHub the github actions workflow will trigger which builds
the react project, then also pushes it to aws S3 using the secret key pair. This way the keys are not exposed to public
```yml
name: actions
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} Deploy to S3 bucket

on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Sync to S3
        uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@v0.5.1
        with:
          args: --delete
        env:
          AWS_S3_BUCKET: sumeetchand.com.com
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_REGION: us-east-1
          SOURCE_DIR: './build'
```

# CACHES AND ARTIFACTS

Caches are for uploading dependencies for persistent storage between runners, whereas artifacts are for workflow job scope only to 
download/push/zip directories/files.

Caches only upload and save if a workflow is succesfull by creating an end task to save cache for next run.
Viewed under github actions in it's own webpage called caches.

Artifacts will upload at the point of that task being complete to the workflows local scope and do not persist for subsequent runs
however they can be downloaded anytime. You could store/retrieve them to/from a external storage such as S3 bucket and then retrieve for another
run or you can identify a succesfull job that stored an artifact and use GitHub API to curl find and retrieve.
Viewed by clicking on a job and seeing the logs on right side of gui.

Either method ONLY works with absolute file paths so instead of
Linux: ${HOME} use /home/runner/

Be aware that uploading artifacts can upload a zip into itself as a nested zip, therefore when extracting will require extraction twice e.g, ./test.zip/test.zip

# REACT EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

Using CI/CD - to upload React website to S3 static bucket

Assuming you have followed steps above to
a. setup the AWS environment by following ```AWS_web_hosting_commands.md```
b. setup the github with aws keys
c. built the website e.g. by following ```react_commands.md```

1. Create file: .github\workflows\actions.yml in your repo and add data below then push repo to upload
and test website access

```yml
