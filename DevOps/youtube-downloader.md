# TABLE OF CONTENTS

To download YouTube videos (considering you are only downloading your own videos!) you will need to install a software called "yt-dlb" = YouTube Downloader

Requires FFMPEG to be installed and added to environmental variables with .DLL files besides the .exe (only on Windows/Linux)

1. Install FFMPEG as per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77742801/how-do-i-include-ffmpeg-for-development-in-a-windows-program/

2. Instal yt-dlb for your OS https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases 

3. Find the URL of the webpage you are downloading e.g, 

4. Login through Chrome to your YouTube account to bypass age verificaiton which will auto save your cookies

5. Run the command below to download the video into the location run in. (Note if you have FFMPEG installed yt-dlb will auto detect and use it to combine the seperate downloaded audio and video stream)
```bash
yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser chrome https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUsvlCWvQrQ
